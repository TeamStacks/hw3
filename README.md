Problems encountered
=========================

product.html - The Materialize CSS for input fields made it really difficult to line up the search bar with the ‘My Stack’ title. I had to override the width and margins in order to do so. In general, Materialize seems to be rather excessive on the padding (container being 70% of the page’s width was too restrictive).
